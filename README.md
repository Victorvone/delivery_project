Welcome to the repository of my data analysis project for a delivery service.
The company has agreed to the code and insights being shared. However, I can't upload the corresponding data and have to edit the notebook
so that no information or insight can be traced back. Therefore, have fun looking at one of my first data analyst projects for you to see the overall process.

The following Notebook contains an exploratory data analysis and a corresponding customer segmentation of a Dataset of users who have registered to use an online delivery service during September 2019 and either have or have not made orders during the time from then and October 2020.

Next to the exploratory data analysis, the task is to generate meaningful insights for the marketing team that help activate different types of users and a corresponding user segmentation.

Packages and libraries used in the notebook:
- pandas
- pandas_profiling
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- plotly
- scipy
